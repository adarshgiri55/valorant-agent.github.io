            <h2 class="heading" id="h1">New Agent</h2>
            <p class="p1"> Hailing from India's coast, Harbor storms the field wielding ancient technology with dominion over water. He unleashes frothing rapids and crushing waves to shield his allies and to pummel those that oppose him.An accomplished historian and antiquarian, Harbor is never shy to proclaim his knowledge and fascination about the worlds of ancient artifacts, history, and architecture. He seems to enjoy his job of working with historical relics and structures. Assign him anywhere in the world, and he just might be able to share a tidbit of his current location's history.Generally, Harbor is depicted to be an agent with a cheerful personality, his speeches encouraging confidence among his teammates and filled with endearing mirth. He has shown to be an individual with considerable experience in combat, coming from his extended period of time serving under REALM, wherein he built a reputation of being an exemplary soldier worthy of being deemed as a legend. Outside of being an operative, Harbor has also built a reputation of being the "nicest guy you'll ever meet" - assuming you're on the same side as him. </p>
